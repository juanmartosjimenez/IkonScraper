# IkonScraper

Script repeatedly checks the Ikon Pass website for an open reservation slot at a given mountain.

Ikon Pass is a season ski lift ticket that requires day-pass reservations at some mountains. Using this scrapper I can find available slots at mountains where it can sometimes be difficult to find open slots.
